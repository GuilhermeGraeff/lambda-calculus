ghc: sorry! (unimplemented feature or known bug)
  (GHC version 8.8.4 for x86_64-unknown-linux):
         Trying to allocate more than 129024 bytes.

This is currently not possible due to a limitation of GHC's code generator.
See http://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/4505 for details.
Suggestion: read data from a file instead of having large static data
structures in code.
